# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Two branches in this project
* `master` branch - is used until we started applying `react-router-dom` loader()s and action()s and dynamic routes.
* `data_fetching_and_sbmitting_with_loaders_and_actions_also_dymanic_routing branch` - is used at the end of tutorial to apply different approact to avoid useState and use what `react-router-dom` can offer

## Legacy tutorial reminders
This is what I initially used until the course was updated.
